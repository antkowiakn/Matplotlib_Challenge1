# Matplotlib_Challenge1
Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals, they began screening for treatments for a commonly skin cancer. In their most recent study of mice, identified with the common skin cancer growths were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. This study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug, Capomulin, versus the other regimens.

Before beginning the analysis, check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.

Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study.


Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.

Select a random mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.

Generate a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot.

Write at least three observations that can be made from the data.
